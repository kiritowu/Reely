{"https://blog.csdn.net/csdnnews/article/details/153425835": "The 2025 Global Machine Learning Technology Conference held in Beijing brought together over 50 global experts to discuss AI's future, with key insights emphasizing that language is central to general intelligence and that Transformers alone are insufficient for achieving higher intelligence. The conference featured major report releases including the AI-Native Software Development Maturity Model (AISMM) with five maturity levels and the 2025 Global Open Source Development Report highlighting China-US leadership in AI development. Technical discussions covered the evolution from Transformer 'knowledge movers' to 'Researcher' models capable of scientific partnership, with presentations on reinforcement learning frameworks achieving 2.77x training acceleration and AI platform development challenges. Panel debates addressed fundamental paradigm questions including the visual versus language route to AGI, whether AI Agents represent a true paradigm or bubble (concluding they are valid but need approximately 5 years for mature implementation), and the multi-modal integration requirements for achieving artificial general intelligence.", "https://blog.csdn.net/csdnnews/article/details/153425820": "Microsoft has introduced new Copilot usage benchmarks in its Viva Insights tool that allows managers to monitor and compare employee AI usage across teams, regions, and job functions, effectively creating internal rankings of who uses AI the most. The system tracks 'active Copilot users' who perform intentional AI operations in Microsoft applications like Teams, Outlook, Word, and Excel, and provides both internal team comparisons and external benchmarks against other companies using anonymized data. From a business perspective, this helps companies track return on investment for expensive Copilot licenses and identify which teams are leading or lagging in AI adoption to improve productivity metrics. However, this 'ranking-style' management approach raises concerns about excessive employee monitoring and potential negative impacts on creativity, with some research suggesting that mandatory AI usage may actually reduce efficiency for experienced workers on complex tasks.", "https://blog.csdn.net/csdnnews/article/details/153356729": "The Free Software Foundation (FSF) has launched a new project called 'Librephone' aimed at giving users complete control over their mobile phones through reverse engineering to eliminate technical barriers that prevent free use of mobile devices. The project seeks to create a 'full-stack free mobile platform' from bottom-layer firmware to top-layer applications, going beyond existing solutions like Android and iOS. FSF has hired veteran developer Rob Savoye as technical lead to investigate and address the remaining proprietary binary modules (blobs) that exist even in open-source Android distributions like LineageOS. The ultimate goal is to bridge the final gap between existing open-source Android versions and truly free software, creating a completely free mobile operating system that doesn't rely on any proprietary components.", "https://blog.csdn.net/csdnnews/article/details/153356745": "Engineer Rui Carmo, despite being a long-time open-source advocate and Mac user skeptical of big company culture, joined Microsoft 10 years ago to participate in the development of hyperscale cloud services after 15 years in telecommunications. He experienced five distinct eras during his Microsoft tenure: Azure and early deployments, cloud analytics/machine learning, the Teams era during COVID, a strategic detour back to telecom roots, and the current generative AI transformation. Throughout his journey, he learned that adaptation to constant change is a critical skill at Microsoft, as the company continuously evolves with quarterly modifications, unlike traditional companies that avoid deep organizational changes. While maintaining his role as Senior Project Architect, he emphasizes work-life balance by prioritizing health over work, continues pursuing personal interests in hardware and electronics, and maintains realistic expectations about AI technology limitations despite the current industry hype.", "https://blog.csdn.net/qq_41140324/article/details/153273595": "The author began their AutoHotkey journey to create simple automation scripts for gaming due to wrist problems from repetitive gameplay, starting with basic AHK commands like Send and Sleep. When these scripts failed to work in games due to compatibility issues between AHK's simulated input and games' use of DirectInput/RawInput, the author discovered that AHK sends Windows messages while games read from lower-level input sources. This led to the adoption of AutoHotInterception (AHI), which uses the Interception.sys driver to inject real keyboard input signals at the driver level, successfully bypassing game input restrictions. Through this technical evolution from simple automation to driver-level input manipulation, the author gained deep insights into Windows input system architecture and developed an \"automation mindset\" for making computers work proactively rather than reactively."}
