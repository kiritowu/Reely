The Blackwell chip features 208 billion transistors in a dual-chip design using TSMC's custom 4NP process, designed specifically for artificial intelligence applications with 10TB/s interconnect speed between the two sub-chips. Jensen Huang emphasized the historic significance of the achievement, stating that workers are part of a transformative moment while acknowledging TSMC's critical role in enabling NVIDIA's AI chip innovations.

Under his leadership, Fuyao Glass grew from a small township factory into the world's largest automotive glass manufacturer, holding over 65% of China's market share and 30% globally, with revenue growing from 236 billion yuan in 2021 to 392.5 billion yuan in 2024. His son Cao Hui, who has 10 years of co-management experience and previously led the North American operations, was unanimously elected as the new Chairman, while Cao Dewang will remain as \"Lifetime Honorary Chairman\" and continue as director of core subsidiaries. The company emphasized that this structured transition will not affect daily operations, with all established strategies, financial policies, and customer orders remaining stable, while Citigroup upgraded their profit forecasts and raised the target price in response to the leadership change.", "https://36kr.com/p/3514290006186883": "Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book) has launched a new second-hand trading feature called \"\u5feb\u6377\u552e\u5356\" (Quick Selling) to directly compete with Alibaba's Xianyu platform, requiring users to have accounts over 180 days old with real-name verification and charging transaction fees of 0.6-1% based on annual sales volume. The platform leverages its superior algorithm capabilities to precisely match buyers and sellers based on content preferences and interests, giving it a potential advantage over established competitors in connecting users with similar needs. However, Xiaohongshu faces significant challenges including the lack of a robust trust and security system compared to Xianyu's established credit systems, the risk of users jumping to more trusted platforms for actual transactions, and potential infiltration by businesses that could damage the community atmosphere. While the feature may succeed in specific categories like local furniture sales or rental services, the article concludes that Xiaohongshu's success in this highly competitive second-hand market depends on its ability to overcome trust issues and build proper dispute resolution infrastructure, with the risk of remaining merely an \"information hub\" rather than a full transaction platform."}
