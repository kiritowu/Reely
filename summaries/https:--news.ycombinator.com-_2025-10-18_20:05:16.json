{"https://dotslashwatch.com/": "The ./watch is a quartz watch project that embraces a unique design philosophy by showcasing electronic components rather than hiding them, taking inspiration from command-line interfaces and computer hardware. Unlike traditional quartz watches that conceal their digital elements, this project deliberately makes the electronic components visible as part of the aesthetic design. The project is structured into three main development areas: Electronics focusing on PCB-design decisions, Software covering firmware design and planning, and Hardware dealing with case design prototypes and revisions. The project is open-source with an associated GitHub repository, representing a novel approach to wearable technology that celebrates rather than disguises its digital nature.", "https://github.com/OpenMixerProject/StageConnect": "StageConnect is an Arduino library that enables the creation of StageConnect devices using AnalogDevices AD242x-ICs like the AD2428, serving as either subordinated node devices or controlling main devices. The project is based on automotive A\u00b2B (Audio Bus) technology and is primarily used to connect professional audio equipment such as the Behringer WING to the Midas DP48. The system transmits 32 channels of uncompressed 48kHz 32-bit audio through simple XLR connectors between devices, utilizing Analog Devices' A\u00b2B audio bus technology. The main device establishes communication through a virtual I2C connection that routes through the A2B-link via the AD242x-IC to an Arduino microcontroller, with the library requiring regular updates every 100ms and supporting callback functions and mailbox systems for receiving channel names from host devices.", "https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/andrej-karpathy": "Andrej Karpathy predicts that truly functional AI agents will take about a decade to develop, coining the term \"decade of agents\" in contrast to industry claims of this being the \"year of agents.\" Current AI systems like Claude and Codex have fundamental cognitive deficits including lack of continual learning, insufficient intelligence for complex tasks, limited multimodal capabilities, and inability to effectively use computers as human employees would. Karpathy argues that while current AI learns through \"imitation of humans and internet data,\" we need to separate the \"cognitive core\" (intelligence algorithms) from knowledge to create agents that can work beyond their training distribution. Based on his 15 years of AI experience, he believes these challenges are \"tractable\" and \"surmountable\" but acknowledges they remain \"difficult\" problems that require significant research breakthroughs.", "status": "success"}
